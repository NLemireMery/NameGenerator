# NameGenerator
Randomly generates a full name (first and last) for the user according to a specified gender &amp; setting.

## What is it for?
**Name Generator** (*yes that's an inspired app name*) is here to help all creators who are in the process of creating a character or story.

If you're writing a novel, if you're preparing a TTRPG game with some friends...  in short, if you just need a hand in choosing a character's name for whatever reason! :)

## Where does it go from here?
- [ ] Design rework
- [ ] Non-binary feature
- [ ] Different names for different settings (so far, thinking about sci-fi, fantasy, contemporary)
- [ ] Choose names according to different regions of the world
